# Behavioral-Context-Recognition
Project on behavioral context recognition for IoT Data Analytics course.

This project spans from the work of Vaizman et. al(http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/) which studied the relationship between sensors' data (from phones and smartwatches) and behavioral recognition.

We will analyze the same problem of the sensors' measurements-behavior recognition relationship by treating the data in form of time series data.
